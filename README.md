# TailwindersProject
By: Ishayu Mahendra, Andrew Kendrick, Samhit Reddy, Rajdeep Bhullar

This project aims to create a social media-like service involving polls. Users can create a poll and post it on to a universal feed that others can then vote on. These polls can range from professors, classes or events at UGA. The goal of this project is to give students an easier way to share their opinion and become informed about how their peers are feeling about life on campus. 

## Notable Features
- Instant poll generation via Google's Gemini API
-	Cloud image storage via Backblaze B2 free tier (AWS S3 alternative)
-	Leaderboard showing top users in terms of polls contributed.

## Accomplishments & Challenges
We built a serverless Next.JS application that enables the university community to create, answer, and analyze polls.  It utilizes Backblaze B2, an AWS S3 alternative, to store user-uploaded images, and offers users the ability to randomly generate polls related to the University of Georgia, Athens-Clarke County, and other topics via Googleâ€™s Gemini AI model.

By far, our largest challenge was learning Next.JS as we went.  Many of us spent hours perusing Next.JS, React, and Tailwind documentation to fully understand this technology stack.  It is without a doubt that these technologies have a major learning curve, and we are proud of the work it took to get here.

Another challenge we faced was the tight timeline of this project.  Given more time, we would have been able to fully flesh out the implementation of our features.  While we were unable to implement all the functionality we initially planned for, all of us are happy with what we have achieved in the result.
