# TailwindersProject
By: Ishayu Mahendra, Andrew Kendrick, Samhit Reddy, Rajdeep Bhullar

This project aims to create a social media-like service involving polls. Users can create a poll and post it on to a universal feed that others can then vote on. These polls can range from professors, classes or events at UGA. The goal of this project is to give students an easier way to share their opinion and become informed about how their peers are feeling about life on campus. 

Along with voting, they are able to save polls and there is a daily, automatically generated one.
